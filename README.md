Report to be submitted.

In your project, you will need to come up with your own research question(s) appropriate for the data, then clean and tidy the data as necessary and perform basic exploratory data analysis including data displays and summaries. You may also use statistical methods you have studied in your other modules (DS663, DS665, ST683 and ST685). A good report will tell a story about the data.

The end result is a reproducible report in HTML produced by R Markdown. One of the group should upload a folder to Moodle containing the final HTML. It should also contain the .Rmd file that produced the HTML report, your data, and any other files your .Rmd file leverages (images, .bib file, etc.). I expect to be able to fully reproduce your report by knitting your .Rmd file.

The completed report should be maximum four pages in length, if printed. You may choose to organise the document into tabs, similar to this one. To do this, just make the first heading “## Project instructions {.tabset}” and subsequent headers will go into tabs.
